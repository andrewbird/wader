Wader-0.3.6
Overview of changes since Wader-0.3.5.2
=======================================

This is a new minor stable release of Wader. List of changes:

* wader-core
    * DNS update mechanisms have been harmonized, see #154. On Ubuntu
      hardy, wader-core does not depend on resolvconf anymore as it
      causes conflicts with the stock NetworkManager.
    * New device supported: Novatel MC990D
    * Start and restart scripts merged into one: wader-core-ctl

* wader-gtk
    * Fix PUK/PUK2 handling, see #148
    * Make sure profiles work with GConf-DBus, see #144

* wader-doc
    * Documentation migrated to Sphinx and revised
    * wader-doc is no longer built by default, thus saving us from
      maintaining many, buggy, dependencies.

Overview of changes since Wader-0.3.1
=====================================

This is a new minor stable release of Wader. List of changes:

    * NetworkManager compatibility has been temporally disabled, our
    three target distros ship with different snapshots of NM/MM and
    they don't include some later patches required for compatibility.
    See [0] for more info. This has the downside of firefox not realizing
    that we are connected and it will insist on that we are disconnected. A
    simple workaround is to check the "Work offline" checkbox in "File".

    * NMPPPDDialer now listens to PropertyChanged signals
    * Make sure dialers are unexported upon unsuccessful connection attempt.
