Coding guidelines
=================

Like any well behaved python project out there, we are `PEP-8`_ compliant.
All the gory details are in the link, a quick way to find out whether your
code is complaint or not is via lints, such as `pylint`_ or `pep8`_.

.. _PEP-8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _pylint: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylint
.. _pep8: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8


Documentation guidelines
========================

All the documentation must be written in `rst`_. From the API documentation
to developer documentation, everything must be written in this lightweight
format.

Project guidelines
==================

 * Testing: We have strived for a good coverage in the core, and we want not
   only to keep it this way, but we want even better coverage. So every
   testable feature to be added to the core must be comprehensively tested.
   The `twisted tool`_ that we use for testing has a `coverage`_ switch that
   is very handy to back up this bold statements.

 * Databases: As we had some bad experiences with ORMs in the past, and our
   models are not that complex, we chose to create our own ORM layer. No, we
   are not suffering from NIH syndrome, it is a very simple piece of code.
   Anyway all the DB related code is contained in `wader.common.provider` and
   tested in `wader.test.test_provider`. The schema and all the ORM related
   methods must be there. Client code should never deal with cursors,
   connections, etc.

 * Portability: A great deal of effort has been invested on making this
   code base as portable as possible (runs on OSX and Linux). As such, you
   can not add a coupling in the code to any OS. All the troublesome methods
   are abstracted out via the `wader.common.oal` module. Similarly, some
   modules were designed with portability in mind in order to add new supported
   platforms in the future. I am talking about modules such as
   `wader.common.config`, `wader.common.profiles`, `wader.common.keyring`, etc.
